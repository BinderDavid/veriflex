# Veriflex

Veriflex is a verified lexer generator for Lean 4 based on [Brzozowski derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative) of regular expressions.
Its design is heavily inspired by the paper [Verbatim: A Verified Lexer Generator](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474322) by Egolf, Lasser and Fisher.
