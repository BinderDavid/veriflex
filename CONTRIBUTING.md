# Contributing

Contributions in the form of bug fixes, feature requests etc. are very welcome!
If you want to implement a new feature, please make sure to open an issue first to discuss possible design alternatives.

This project is developed in tandem with [haskell-spec](github.com/BinderDavid/haskell-spec).
Features which are not compatible with the requirements of that project can therefore not be included, but features which make the lexer more generally applicable are always welcome.
